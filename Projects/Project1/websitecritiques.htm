        <ul>
            <li>
                My first impression of the site was that there is a lot going on
                and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to look at first.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site organizes the flow of information by having a sidbar on
                the left hand side with links to main pages within the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site structure makes sense for the most part but I will
                admit there is a little too much text to read. I don't want a
                lot of text. It should be a quick look.
            </li>
            <li>
                I think the graphics enhance the site. For trader joes you'd
                expect to see pictures of food on the website so it accomplishes
                that very well.
            </li>
            <li>
                The loading time for the homepage was very quick. I think it's
                because most of the information is static data so there's not a
                ton of server load.
            </li>
            <li>
                The font sizes and background colors aren't too distracting. The
                font is nice and pleasing and easy to read.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site has two naviation bars. It's got a side bar with 4
                links then a hamburger menu with way too much going on. It has
                so many links in the hamburger menu you start to get
                overwhelmed.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site did have a theme I felt. Most of the background colors
                are real earthy colors. Light browns, mustard yellows, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The site does a great job with the responsive design. I tried it
                on desktop, tablet and mobile view and it all looked really
                good.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was unusual that there were 2 navigation menus. I guess there
                was just so much content it didn't do the best at letting you
                know where to go first or how to find something quick.
            </li>
        </ul>
